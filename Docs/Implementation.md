  - [x] **Phase 3.1: Fix Page Refresh Issue with CSS-Only Transitions** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    - **Problem**: Custom JavaScript transition logic causing page refreshes and header/navigation disappearing
    - **Root Cause**: React element comparison conflicts with Next.js App Router navigation timing
    - **Solution**: Remove JavaScript transition logic, implement pure CSS transitions that work with Next.js
    - **Implementation Steps**:
      1. ‚úÖ Reverted MainLayout to simple version (removed custom transition state management)
      2. ‚úÖ Updated CSS for route-based transitions using data attributes and key prop
      3. ‚úÖ Let Next.js handle navigation naturally while adding CSS slide animations
      4. ‚úÖ Tested transitions across all main navigation routes (Discover ‚Üí Add Dish ‚Üí My Dishes ‚Üí My Wishlist)
      5. ‚úÖ Verified no more page refreshes or disappearing header/navigation
      6. ‚úÖ Enhanced animation timing for better visibility (400ms duration, 40px slide distance)
    - **Files Modified**: `components/main-layout.tsx`, `app/globals.css`
    - **Result**: Smooth, visible slide transitions without page refreshes, consistent header/navigation
  - [ ] **Phase 3.2: Navigation Enhancement** (Deferred)
    - Add subtle scale animation (1.05x) on active nav items
    - Implement smooth color transitions for active states
    - Add press animation (0.95x scale) for mobile taps

    - Subtle hover effects for desktop users
    - Smooth transitions between form steps (if any)
    - Success state animations for form submissions

**Technical Implementation Details for Phase 3.1 (Completed):**
- **Approach**: CSS-only transitions using Next.js key prop and data attributes (no JavaScript transition logic)
- **Animation Timing**: 400ms entry (ease-out), 40px slide distance - enhanced for better visibility
- **Performance**: Mobile-first with 60fps target, works with Next.js App Router optimizations
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion support and maintained keyboard navigation
- **CSS Strategy**: Transform-based animations triggered by route changes, hardware-accelerated
- **Implementation**: Pure CSS @keyframes with transform: translateX() and opacity transitions

**Implementation Priority & Rationale:**
1. **Phase 3.1 (Current Issue)**: Fix page refresh problem first - immediate user experience issue causing visual glitches
2. **Stage 8 Performance Optimization (Future Issue)**: Address unnecessary API calls second - performance improvement but not breaking functionality
3. **Rationale**: Current issue affects every navigation, while performance issue is more subtle but impacts overall app speed

- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with environment configuration
- [ ] Add invite code verification feedback
- [ ] Implement secure invite code passing
- [ ] Add UX improvements to auth flow
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing
- [ ] Optimize performance and fix bugs

### Stage 8: Performance Optimization (V2)
**Duration:** 3-4 days
**Dependencies:** Stage 7 completion

#### Sub-steps:
- [ ] **Fix Unnecessary Re-loading Issue**: Prevent unnecessary API calls and loading states on page navigation
  - **Problem**: Every page visit triggers fresh API calls for user data (name, city) even when data hasn't changed
  - **Root Cause**: Client-side rendered pages re-initialize on navigation, no caching or state persistence
  - **Evidence**: Terminal logs show repeated `/api/users` calls on every page visit (lines 23-294 in terminal output)
  - **Solution**: Implement user data caching and state persistence in session provider
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    1. Add user data caching logic to SessionProvider with timestamp-based expiration
    2. Implement React Query or SWR for API response caching
    3. Add loading state optimization to prevent unnecessary spinners for cached data
    4. Test navigation between pages to verify reduced API calls
    5. Verify faster page loads and better user experience
  - **Files to Modify**: `lib/auth/session-provider.tsx`, potentially add React Query/SWR
  - **Expected Result**: No unnecessary API calls, faster page loads, better perceived performance
- [ ] Implement server-side sorting and filtering
- [ ] Add database indexing for performance
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize query performance
- [ ] Add caching strategies
- [ ] Performance testing and monitoring
