## [BUG-002] - Phone Number Exposure in User Profile API

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-002
- **Title**: Phone Number Exposure in User Profile API
- **Severity**: High (Security)
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2024-12-19
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The GET `/api/users` endpoint returns all user fields including sensitive phone numbers, creating a security vulnerability where phone numbers are exposed to the frontend and potentially logged or cached.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Navigate to any page that fetches user profile data (homepage, account page)
4. Check the Network tab for GET `/api/users` requests
5. Observe that the response includes the `phone` field

### Expected Behavior
- The API should only return safe, non-sensitive user data (id, name, city, created_at)
- Phone numbers should never be exposed in API responses
- User names should display correctly on the homepage

### Actual Behavior
- The API returns all user fields including `phone` number
- Phone numbers are exposed in API responses
- This creates a security vulnerability

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **API Endpoint**: GET `/api/users`
- **Current Implementation**: Uses `.select("*")` which returns all fields
- **Security Issue**: Phone numbers included in response

### Root Cause
The GET handler in `/api/users/route.ts` uses `.select("*")` instead of selecting only the necessary fields, exposing sensitive data.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Update GET /api/users endpoint** to select only safe fields:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of .select("*")
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from("users")
     .select("id, name, city, created_at")
     .eq("id", user.id)
     .single();
   ```

2. **Test the fix** to ensure:
   - Phone numbers are no longer exposed
   - User names still display correctly on homepage
   - Account page functionality remains intact

3. **Verify no breaking changes** to:
   - Login/signup process
   - Profile creation
   - Other API endpoints

### Prevention Measures
- Implement field selection best practices for all API endpoints
- Add security review checklist for sensitive data exposure
- Consider implementing API response validation

### Testing
- [x] Verify phone numbers are not exposed in API responses
- [x] Test homepage displays user names correctly
- [x] Test account page functionality
- [x] Verify login/signup process unaffected
- [x] Test profile creation process

### Notes
- This is a simple fix that doesn't require database schema changes
- Phone numbers remain stored in the database for authentication purposes
- Only the API response needs to be secured

## [BUG-004] - Client-Side Sorting Performance Limitation

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-004
- **Title**: Client-Side Sorting Performance Limitation
- **Severity**: Medium (Performance)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Deferred to V2
- **Date Reported**: 2025-01-30
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
Current price sorting is implemented client-side, which will not scale well with large datasets. All dishes are fetched from the database and sorted in the browser, causing performance issues as the database grows.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the homepage
2. Use the "Sort by Price" dropdown
3. Select "Price: Low to High" or "Price: High to Low"
4. Observe that sorting happens in the browser after all data is loaded

### Expected Behavior
- Sorting should be performed at the database level for optimal performance
- Only relevant data should be fetched based on filters and sorting
- Large datasets should not impact browser performance

### Actual Behavior
- All dishes are fetched from the database regardless of sorting preference
- Sorting is performed client-side using JavaScript
- Browser performance degrades with large datasets

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **Component**: Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Current Implementation**: Client-side sorting in lines 191-212
- **API Endpoint**: GET `/api/dishes` returns all dishes
- **Performance Issue**: O(n log n) sorting in browser vs O(n) database sorting

### Root Cause
The current implementation prioritizes MVP functionality over performance optimization. Client-side sorting was chosen for simplicity and rapid development, but it doesn't scale with database growth.

### Current Implementation
```typescript
// Client-side sorting in app/page.tsx (lines 191-212)
const filteredDishes = dishes
  .filter((dish) => {
    const cityMatch = dish.city === userCity
    const proteinMatch = selectedProteinFilter === "All" || dish.protein_source === selectedProteinFilter
    return cityMatch && proteinMatch
  })
  .sort((a, b) => {
    // Price parsing and sorting logic
    const parsePrice = (p: string | undefined) => {
      if (!p) return NaN
      const n = Number(String(p).replace(/[^0-9.]/g, ""))
      return isNaN(n) ? NaN : n
    }
    // ... sorting logic
  })
```

### Future Solution
- **Server-Side Sorting**: Use Supabase's built-in sorting capabilities
- **Database Indexing**: Add indexes on price, city, and protein_source columns
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large result sets
- **Query Optimization**: Use Supabase client for direct database queries

## [FEATURE-001] - Add Restaurant Name Field to Online Dish Form
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Add Dish Form

### Description
The online dish form was missing a restaurant name field, which is essential for identifying where the dish was found. Users could only select a delivery app and provide a URL, but not specify the restaurant name.

### Root Cause
The form implementation only captured restaurant names for "In-Restaurant" dishes but not for "Online" dishes, despite the database schema supporting restaurant names for both types.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Added State Management**
   - Added `onlineRestaurant` state variable to track restaurant name for online dishes
   - Updated form validation to require restaurant name for online dishes

2. **Updated Form UI**
   - Added restaurant name input field in the online section
   - Positioned between delivery app selection and URL input
   - Used placeholder "Enter Outlet Name" as requested
   - Made field required for online dishes

3. **Updated Data Submission**
   - Modified `dishData` object to use `onlineRestaurant` for online dishes
   - Maintained existing `restaurant` state for in-restaurant dishes
   - Added validation to prevent submission without restaurant name

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Added state variable
const [onlineRestaurant, setOnlineRestaurant] = useState("")

// Added validation
if (sourceType === "Online" && !onlineRestaurant) {
  alert("Restaurant name is required for online dishes.");
  return;
}

// Updated data submission
restaurant_name: sourceType === "Online" ? onlineRestaurant : restaurant,

// Added form field
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label htmlFor="onlineRestaurant">Restaurant Name</Label>
  <Input
    id="onlineRestaurant"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Enter Outlet Name"
    value={onlineRestaurant}
    onChange={(e) => setOnlineRestaurant(e.target.value)}
    required
  />
</div>
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form validation works correctly for online dishes
- ✅ Restaurant name is properly captured and submitted
- ✅ UI follows existing design patterns
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can now properly identify restaurants for online dishes
- **Data Quality**: Improved data completeness for online dish entries
- **Consistency**: Both in-restaurant and online dishes now capture restaurant names

## [FEATURE-002] - Make URL Field Optional in Online Dish Form
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Add Dish Form

### Description
The "Paste Link to Dish" field in the online dish form was marked as required, but users should be able to submit dishes without providing a URL. This field should be optional to improve user experience and reduce friction in dish submission.

### Root Cause
The form field had the `required` attribute and no visual indication that it was optional, making it mandatory for users to provide a URL even when they might not have one readily available.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Updated Form Field**
   - Removed `required` attribute from the URL input field
   - Updated label to include "(Optional)" to clearly indicate the field is not mandatory
   - Maintained URL input type for validation when a value is provided

2. **Verified Data Handling**
   - Confirmed API already handles empty URLs with `dishLink || null`
   - Verified database schema supports nullable URL fields
   - No changes needed to backend data processing

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Updated label
<Label htmlFor="dishLink">Paste Link to Dish (Optional)</Label>

// Updated input field (removed required attribute)
<Input
  id="dishLink"
  type="url"
  placeholder="https://..."
  value={dishLink}
  onChange={(e) => setDishLink(e.target.value)}
  // required attribute removed
/>
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form can be submitted without URL
- ✅ URL validation still works when provided
- ✅ Clear visual indication that field is optional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Reduced friction in dish submission process
- **Flexibility**: Users can add dishes without needing to find URLs
- **Data Quality**: Still captures URLs when available for better discoverability

---

### Proposed Implementation
```typescript
// Future server-side implementation
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('dishes')
  .select('*')
  .eq('city', userCity)
  .eq('protein_source', selectedProteinFilter)
  .order('price', { ascending: priceSort === 'low-to-high' })
  .range(0, 19) // Pagination
```

### Impact Assessment
- **Current**: Works fine with small datasets (< 100 dishes)
- **Future**: Will need server-side implementation for scalability
- **Performance**: Client-side sorting is O(n log n) vs database O(n)
- **Network**: Unnecessary data transfer for large datasets
- **Memory**: High browser memory usage with large datasets

### Prevention Measures
- Plan for scalability from the beginning
- Consider performance implications of client-side operations
- Implement server-side sorting for production applications
- Add database indexing for frequently queried columns

### Testing
- [ ] Test current implementation with small dataset (< 50 dishes)
- [ ] Monitor performance with medium dataset (50-200 dishes)
- [ ] Document performance degradation with large datasets
- [ ] Plan server-side implementation for V2

### Notes
- This is a known limitation, not a bug
- Current implementation is acceptable for MVP
- Server-side sorting will be implemented in V2 for performance optimization
- Consider implementing pagination alongside server-side sorting

## [BUG-003] - Homepage Greeting Shows Placeholder Instead of User Name

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-003
- **Title**: Homepage Greeting Shows Placeholder Instead of User Name
- **Severity**: Medium (UX)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2024-12-19
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The homepage greeting displays "Hey User!" instead of the actual user's name, creating a poor user experience where users don't see their personalized greeting.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Observe the greeting message at the top
4. Notice it shows "Hey User!" instead of the actual user's name

### Expected Behavior
- The homepage should display "Hey [Actual User Name]!" using the user's real name from their profile
- The greeting should be personalized and welcoming

### Actual Behavior
- The homepage shows "Hey User!" as a generic placeholder
- No personalization in the greeting message

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **Component**: Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Issue**: Using `user?.user_metadata?.name` which may not contain the user's actual name
- **Root Cause**: Not fetching user name from the secure profile API

### Root Cause
The homepage was using `user?.user_metadata?.name` from the session instead of fetching the user's actual name from the secure `/api/users` endpoint that returns the profile data.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Add userName state** to store the fetched user name:
   ```typescript
   const [userName, setUserName] = useState("User")
   ```

2. **Update profile fetching** to also set the user name:
   ```typescript
   if (response.ok) {
     const data = await response.json()
     setUserCity(data.city || "Mumbai")
     setUserName(data.name || "User")  // ← Added this line
   }
   ```

3. **Remove dependency** on `user?.user_metadata?.name` and use the state variable instead

### Prevention Measures
- Always fetch user profile data from secure API endpoints
- Use consistent state management for user data across components
- Test personalized greetings during development

### Testing
- [x] Verify homepage shows actual user name in greeting
- [x] Test with different user names
- [x] Verify fallback to "User" when name is not available
- [x] Test loading states work correctly

### Notes
- This fix works in conjunction with the security fix for phone number exposure
- The user name is now fetched securely from the profile API
- Maintains consistent user experience across the application

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-005
- **Title**: Multi-Select Delivery Apps Styling and Alignment Issues
- **Severity**: Medium (UX)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Partially Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2025-01-30
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The multi-select dropdown for delivery apps in the add-dish form had styling issues:
1. Selected delivery app pills were cyan-colored instead of matching the design system
2. Pills were not properly aligned within the dropdown selection frame
3. Vertical padding was uneven (less on top, more on bottom)
4. Pills were not horizontally aligned to the left edge of the dropdown

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Add Dish page
2. Select "Online" as the source type
3. Open the "Delivery Apps" multi-select dropdown
4. Select multiple delivery apps (e.g., "Zomato", "Uber Eats")
5. Observe the styling and alignment of the selected pills

### Expected Behavior
- Selected delivery app pills should match the design system (light gray background, dark text, border)
- Pills should be properly aligned within the dropdown frame
- Vertical alignment should be centered
- Horizontal alignment should be flush to the left edge
- Styling should be consistent with other form elements like "Protein Source" pills

### Actual Behavior
- Selected pills were cyan-colored and didn't match the design system
- Pills were misaligned within the dropdown frame
- Uneven vertical padding (more space below than above)
- Pills were not flush to the left edge of the dropdown
- Inconsistent styling compared to other form elements

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Component**: Add Dish Form (`app/add-dish/page.tsx`)
- **UI Component**: Multi-Select (`components/ui/multi-select.tsx`)

### Error Details
- **Component**: `MultiSelect` component in `components/ui/multi-select.tsx`
- **Issue**: Badge styling and container alignment
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect Badge variant and missing alignment classes

### Root Cause
1. **Badge Styling**: The Badge component was using `variant="outline"` with custom classes that didn't properly override the default styling
2. **Design System Mismatch**: The styling didn't match the Button `outline` variant used elsewhere in the design system

### Resolution Steps
1. **Updated Badge Styling** in `components/ui/multi-select.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   className="mr-1 mb-1 bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80"
   
   // To:
   className="mr-1 mb-1 border border-input bg-background text-foreground hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground"
   ```

2. **Matched Design System**:
   - Used `border border-input bg-background text-foreground` to match Button outline variant
   - Added `hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground` for consistent hover states

### Testing Results
- ✅ Selected delivery app pills now have white background with dark text and border
- ✅ Styling matches the "Protein Source" pills and other form elements
- ✅ Hover states work correctly
- ✅ X icon for removal remains functional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ❌ Alignment issues remain (pills still not properly centered or flush to left edge)

### Prevention Measures
- Always test UI components against the design system
- Use consistent styling patterns across similar components
- Test alignment and spacing in different screen sizes
- Verify hover states and interactive elements work correctly

### Notes
- This fix ensures the multi-select component follows the established design system
- The styling now matches other form elements for consistency
- Alignment issues still need to be addressed in a future update
- The fix maintains all existing functionality while improving visual consistency
