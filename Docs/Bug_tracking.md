**Priority:** High
**Component:** Restaurant Search in Add Dish Form

### Description
Integrated Google Maps Places API to provide intelligent restaurant search functionality when adding dishes. Users can now search for restaurants with autocomplete suggestions, location-aware results, and complete restaurant data including addresses and coordinates.

### Implementation Details
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Integrated Google Maps JavaScript API with Places library in layout

2. **TypeScript Definitions**
   - Created `types/google-maps.d.ts` with comprehensive type definitions
   - Added `@types/google.maps` dependency

3. **Custom Hooks**
   - `useGooglePlaces`: Manages Google Places service initialization and API calls
   - `useGeolocation`: Handles location permission requests and user location data

4. **RestaurantSearchInput Component**
   - Real-time autocomplete with Google Places predictions
   - Location-aware search (with user's current location if permitted)
   - Fallback to city-based search if location denied
   - Displays selected restaurant details with ratings and address

5. **Form Integration**
   - Replaced basic text input with intelligent restaurant search
   - Added location permission request UI
   - Integrated restaurant data (name, address, coordinates) into form submission
   - Enhanced validation to ensure restaurant selection

### Key Features
- **Location-Aware Search**: Results ranked by proximity to user's location
- **City-Based Fallback**: Comprehensive search within user's selected city
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful fallback when location access denied

1. User selects "In-Restaurant" source type
2. System requests location permission with clear benefits explanation
3. If granted: Search restaurants near current location
4. If denied: Search restaurants in selected city
5. Real-time autocomplete suggestions appear as user types
6. User selects restaurant from suggestions or search results
7. Restaurant details (name, address, coordinates) auto-populate form
8. Enhanced data stored in database for future features

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Location permission with smart fallbacks
const { userLocation, locationPermissionGranted } = useGeolocation()

// Google Places integration
const { searchRestaurants, getAutocompletePredictions } = useGooglePlaces({
  userCity,
  userLocation
})

// Restaurant data capture
const handleRestaurantSelect = (restaurant: RestaurantResult) => {
  setSelectedRestaurant(restaurant)
  // Auto-populate form with complete restaurant data
}
```

### Cost Analysis
- **Cost**: Nearly FREE for MVP scale (within Google's free tiers)
- **Usage**: Well within 5,000 free requests per month for MVP user base
- **Production**: Minimal cost even with moderate growth

### Future Benefits
- **Distance-Based Sorting**: Enable "Show me nearby chicken dishes"
- **Chain Location Selection**: Users can choose specific restaurant branches
- **Navigation Integration**: Direct navigation to restaurants
- **Hyperlocal Discovery**: "Dishes available near me right now"

### Testing Results
- ✅ Restaurant autocomplete works correctly
- ✅ Location-aware search functions properly

## [BUG-002] - Phone Number Exposure in User Profile API

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-002
- **Title**: Phone Number Exposure in User Profile API
- **Severity**: High (Security)
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2024-12-19
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The GET `/api/users` endpoint returns all user fields including sensitive phone numbers, creating a security vulnerability where phone numbers are exposed to the frontend and potentially logged or cached.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Navigate to any page that fetches user profile data (homepage, account page)
4. Check the Network tab for GET `/api/users` requests
5. Observe that the response includes the `phone` field

### Expected Behavior
- The API should only return safe, non-sensitive user data (id, name, city, created_at)
- Phone numbers should never be exposed in API responses
- User names should display correctly on the homepage

### Actual Behavior
- The API returns all user fields including `phone` number
- Phone numbers are exposed in API responses
- This creates a security vulnerability

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **API Endpoint**: GET `/api/users`
- **Current Implementation**: Uses `.select("*")` which returns all fields
- **Security Issue**: Phone numbers included in response

### Root Cause
The GET handler in `/api/users/route.ts` uses `.select("*")` instead of selecting only the necessary fields, exposing sensitive data.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Update GET /api/users endpoint** to select only safe fields:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of .select("*")
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from("users")
     .select("id, name, city, created_at")
     .eq("id", user.id)
     .single();
   ```

2. **Test the fix** to ensure:
   - Phone numbers are no longer exposed
   - User names still display correctly on homepage
   - Account page functionality remains intact

3. **Verify no breaking changes** to:
   - Login/signup process
   - Profile creation
   - Other API endpoints

### Prevention Measures
- Implement field selection best practices for all API endpoints
- Add security review checklist for sensitive data exposure
- Consider implementing API response validation

### Testing
- [x] Verify phone numbers are not exposed in API responses
- [x] Test homepage displays user names correctly
- [x] Test account page functionality
- [x] Verify login/signup process unaffected
- [x] Test profile creation process

### Notes
- This is a simple fix that doesn't require database schema changes
- Phone numbers remain stored in the database for authentication purposes
- Only the API response needs to be secured

## [BUG-004] - Client-Side Sorting Performance Limitation

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-004
- **Title**: Client-Side Sorting Performance Limitation
- **Severity**: Medium (Performance)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Deferred to V2
- **Date Reported**: 2025-01-30
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
Current price sorting is implemented client-side, which will not scale well with large datasets. All dishes are fetched from the database and sorted in the browser, causing performance issues as the database grows.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the homepage
2. Use the "Sort by Price" dropdown
3. Select "Price: Low to High" or "Price: High to Low"
4. Observe that sorting happens in the browser after all data is loaded

### Expected Behavior
- Sorting should be performed at the database level for optimal performance
- Only relevant data should be fetched based on filters and sorting
- Large datasets should not impact browser performance

### Actual Behavior
- All dishes are fetched from the database regardless of sorting preference
- Sorting is performed client-side using JavaScript
- Browser performance degrades with large datasets

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **Component**: Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Current Implementation**: Client-side sorting in lines 191-212
- **API Endpoint**: GET `/api/dishes` returns all dishes
- **Performance Issue**: O(n log n) sorting in browser vs O(n) database sorting

### Root Cause
The current implementation prioritizes MVP functionality over performance optimization. Client-side sorting was chosen for simplicity and rapid development, but it doesn't scale with database growth.

### Current Implementation
```typescript
// Client-side sorting in app/page.tsx (lines 191-212)
const filteredDishes = dishes
  .filter((dish) => {
    const cityMatch = dish.city === userCity
    const proteinMatch = selectedProteinFilter === "All" || dish.protein_source === selectedProteinFilter
    return cityMatch && proteinMatch
  })
  .sort((a, b) => {
    // Price parsing and sorting logic
    const parsePrice = (p: string | undefined) => {
      if (!p) return NaN
      const n = Number(String(p).replace(/[^0-9.]/g, ""))
      return isNaN(n) ? NaN : n
    }
    // ... sorting logic
  })
```

### Future Solution
- **Server-Side Sorting**: Use Supabase's built-in sorting capabilities
- **Database Indexing**: Add indexes on price, city, and protein_source columns
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large result sets
- **Query Optimization**: Use Supabase client for direct database queries

## [FEATURE-001] - Add Restaurant Name Field to Online Dish Form
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Add Dish Form

### Description
The online dish form was missing a restaurant name field, which is essential for identifying where the dish was found. Users could only select a delivery app and provide a URL, but not specify the restaurant name.

### Root Cause
The form implementation only captured restaurant names for "In-Restaurant" dishes but not for "Online" dishes, despite the database schema supporting restaurant names for both types.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Added State Management**
   - Added `onlineRestaurant` state variable to track restaurant name for online dishes
   - Updated form validation to require restaurant name for online dishes

2. **Updated Form UI**
   - Added restaurant name input field in the online section
   - Positioned between delivery app selection and URL input
   - Used placeholder "Enter Outlet Name" as requested
   - Made field required for online dishes

3. **Updated Data Submission**
   - Modified `dishData` object to use `onlineRestaurant` for online dishes
   - Maintained existing `restaurant` state for in-restaurant dishes
   - Added validation to prevent submission without restaurant name

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Added state variable
const [onlineRestaurant, setOnlineRestaurant] = useState("")

// Added validation
if (sourceType === "Online" && !onlineRestaurant) {
  alert("Restaurant name is required for online dishes.");
  return;
}

// Updated data submission
restaurant_name: sourceType === "Online" ? onlineRestaurant : restaurant,

// Added form field
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label htmlFor="onlineRestaurant">Restaurant Name</Label>
  <Input
    id="onlineRestaurant"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Enter Outlet Name"
    value={onlineRestaurant}
    onChange={(e) => setOnlineRestaurant(e.target.value)}
    required
  />
</div>
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form validation works correctly for online dishes
- ✅ Restaurant name is properly captured and submitted
- ✅ UI follows existing design patterns
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can now properly identify restaurants for online dishes
- **Data Quality**: Improved data completeness for online dish entries
- **Consistency**: Both in-restaurant and online dishes now capture restaurant names

## [FEATURE-002] - Make URL Field Optional in Online Dish Form
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Add Dish Form

### Description
The "Paste Link to Dish" field in the online dish form was marked as required, but users should be able to submit dishes without providing a URL. This field should be optional to improve user experience and reduce friction in dish submission.

### Root Cause
The form field had the `required` attribute and no visual indication that it was optional, making it mandatory for users to provide a URL even when they might not have one readily available.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Updated Form Field**
   - Removed `required` attribute from the URL input field
   - Updated label to include "(Optional)" to clearly indicate the field is not mandatory
   - Maintained URL input type for validation when a value is provided

2. **Verified Data Handling**
   - Confirmed API already handles empty URLs with `dishLink || null`
   - Verified database schema supports nullable URL fields
   - No changes needed to backend data processing

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Updated label
<Label htmlFor="dishLink">Paste Link to Dish (Optional)</Label>

// Updated input field (removed required attribute)
<Input
  id="dishLink"
  type="url"
  placeholder="https://..."
  value={dishLink}
  onChange={(e) => setDishLink(e.target.value)}
  // required attribute removed
/>
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form can be submitted without URL
- ✅ URL validation still works when provided
- ✅ Clear visual indication that field is optional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Reduced friction in dish submission process
- **Flexibility**: Users can add dishes without needing to find URLs
- **Data Quality**: Still captures URLs when available for better discoverability

## [FEATURE-003] - Remove URL Field and Add Delivery App Display
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Component:** Add Dish Form, Dish Card

### Description
Most delivery apps (except Zomato) don't provide direct links to specific dishes, making the URL field unnecessary. Additionally, users wanted to see the specific delivery app name in the dish card instead of generic "Online" text, and have buttons that open the specific delivery app.

### Root Cause
1. URL field was capturing data that wasn't useful for most delivery apps
2. Dish cards showed generic "Online" text instead of specific app names
3. Buttons showed generic "View on Delivery App" text instead of specific app names
4. No deep linking functionality to open specific delivery apps

### Resolution Steps
1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Added `delivery_app_name` column to `dishes` table
   - Updated API to store and return delivery app names

2. **Form Updates**
   - Removed URL input field from online dish form
   - Removed `dishLink` state and related logic
   - Updated form submission to include `delivery_app_name`
   - Set `delivery_app_url` to always null

3. **Dish Card Updates**
   - Added `deliveryAppName` prop to `DishCardProps`
   - Updated pill display to show specific app name instead of "Online"
   - Updated button text to show "Open [App Name]" instead of "View on Delivery App"
   - Implemented deep linking functionality for mobile and web

4. **Deep Linking Implementation**
   - Added deep link mappings for Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats, DoorDash
   - Implemented mobile detection and app opening logic
   - Added fallback to web versions when apps aren't installed
   - Used 1-second timeout for deep link failure detection

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Form submission updates
const dishData = {
  // ... existing fields
  delivery_app_name: sourceType === "Online" ? deliveryApp : null,
  delivery_app_url: null, // Always null since we removed URL field
};

// Dish card updates
interface DishCardProps {
  // ... existing props
  deliveryAppName?: string | null;
}

// Pill display
{availability === "Online" ? deliveryAppName || "Online" : availability}

// Button text and action
<Button onClick={handleDeliveryAppClick}>
  <Link className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Open {deliveryAppName || "Delivery App"}
</Button>

// Deep linking logic
const deliveryAppDeepLinks = {
  "Swiggy": { mobile: "swiggy://", web: "https://www.swiggy.com" },
  "Zomato": { mobile: "zomato://", web: "https://www.zomato.com" },
  "Uber Eats": { mobile: "uber://", web: "https://www.ubereats.com" },
  "DoorDash": { mobile: "doordash://", web: "https://www.doordash.com" }
};
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form submission works without URL field
- ✅ Delivery app names display correctly in dish cards
- ✅ Deep linking works on mobile devices
- ✅ Web fallback works on desktop
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Cleaner form and more informative dish cards
- **Functionality**: Direct app opening improves user workflow
- **Data Quality**: Removed unnecessary URL field, added useful app name data
- **Mobile Experience**: Native app opening provides better user experience

---

### Proposed Implementation
```typescript
// Future server-side implementation
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('dishes')
  .select('*')
  .eq('city', userCity)
  .eq('protein_source', selectedProteinFilter)
  .order('price', { ascending: priceSort === 'low-to-high' })
  .range(0, 19) // Pagination
```

### Impact Assessment
- **Current**: Works fine with small datasets (< 100 dishes)
- **Future**: Will need server-side implementation for scalability
- **Performance**: Client-side sorting is O(n log n) vs database O(n)
- **Network**: Unnecessary data transfer for large datasets
- **Memory**: High browser memory usage with large datasets

### Prevention Measures
- Plan for scalability from the beginning
- Consider performance implications of client-side operations
- Implement server-side sorting for production applications
- Add database indexing for frequently queried columns

### Testing
- [ ] Test current implementation with small dataset (< 50 dishes)
- [ ] Monitor performance with medium dataset (50-200 dishes)
- [ ] Document performance degradation with large datasets
- [ ] Plan server-side implementation for V2

### Notes
- This is a known limitation, not a bug
- Current implementation is acceptable for MVP
- Server-side sorting will be implemented in V2 for performance optimization
- Consider implementing pagination alongside server-side sorting

## [BUG-003] - Homepage Greeting Shows Placeholder Instead of User Name

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-003
- **Title**: Homepage Greeting Shows Placeholder Instead of User Name
- **Severity**: Medium (UX)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2024-12-19
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The homepage greeting displays "Hey User!" instead of the actual user's name, creating a poor user experience where users don't see their personalized greeting.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Observe the greeting message at the top
4. Notice it shows "Hey User!" instead of the actual user's name

### Expected Behavior
- The homepage should display "Hey [Actual User Name]!" using the user's real name from their profile
- The greeting should be personalized and welcoming

### Actual Behavior
- The homepage shows "Hey User!" as a generic placeholder
- No personalization in the greeting message

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **Component**: Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Issue**: Using `user?.user_metadata?.name` which may not contain the user's actual name
- **Root Cause**: Not fetching user name from the secure profile API

### Root Cause
The homepage was using `user?.user_metadata?.name` from the session instead of fetching the user's actual name from the secure `/api/users` endpoint that returns the profile data.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Add userName state** to store the fetched user name:
   ```typescript
   const [userName, setUserName] = useState("User")
   ```

2. **Update profile fetching** to also set the user name:
   ```typescript
   if (response.ok) {
     const data = await response.json()
     setUserCity(data.city || "Mumbai")
     setUserName(data.name || "User")  // ← Added this line
   }
   ```

3. **Remove dependency** on `user?.user_metadata?.name` and use the state variable instead

### Prevention Measures
- Always fetch user profile data from secure API endpoints
- Use consistent state management for user data across components
- Test personalized greetings during development

### Testing
- [x] Verify homepage shows actual user name in greeting
- [x] Test with different user names
- [x] Verify fallback to "User" when name is not available
- [x] Test loading states work correctly

### Notes
- This fix works in conjunction with the security fix for phone number exposure
- The user name is now fetched securely from the profile API
- Maintains consistent user experience across the application

## [BUG-005] - Multi-Select Delivery Apps Styling and Alignment Issues

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-005
- **Title**: Multi-Select Delivery Apps Styling and Alignment Issues
- **Severity**: Medium (UX)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Partially Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2025-01-30
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The multi-select dropdown for delivery apps in the add-dish form had styling issues:
1. Selected delivery app pills were cyan-colored instead of matching the design system
2. Pills were not properly aligned within the dropdown selection frame
3. Vertical padding was uneven (less on top, more on bottom)
4. Pills were not horizontally aligned to the left edge of the dropdown

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Add Dish page
2. Select "Online" as the source type
3. Open the "Delivery Apps" multi-select dropdown
4. Select multiple delivery apps (e.g., "Zomato", "Uber Eats")
5. Observe the styling and alignment of the selected pills

### Expected Behavior
- Selected delivery app pills should match the design system (light gray background, dark text, border)
- Pills should be properly aligned within the dropdown frame
- Vertical alignment should be centered
- Horizontal alignment should be flush to the left edge
- Styling should be consistent with other form elements like "Protein Source" pills

### Actual Behavior
- Selected pills were cyan-colored and didn't match the design system
- Pills were misaligned within the dropdown frame
- Uneven vertical padding (more space below than above)
- Pills were not flush to the left edge of the dropdown
- Inconsistent styling compared to other form elements

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Component**: Add Dish Form (`app/add-dish/page.tsx`)
- **UI Component**: Multi-Select (`components/ui/multi-select.tsx`)

### Error Details
- **Component**: `MultiSelect` component in `components/ui/multi-select.tsx`
- **Issue**: Badge styling and container alignment
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect Badge variant and missing alignment classes

### Root Cause
1. **Badge Styling**: The Badge component was using `variant="outline"` with custom classes that didn't properly override the default styling
2. **Design System Mismatch**: The styling didn't match the Button `outline` variant used elsewhere in the design system

### Resolution Steps
1. **Updated Badge Styling** in `components/ui/multi-select.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   className="mr-1 mb-1 bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80"
   
   // To:
   className="mr-1 mb-1 border border-input bg-background text-foreground hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground"
   ```

2. **Matched Design System**:
   - Used `border border-input bg-background text-foreground` to match Button outline variant
   - Added `hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground` for consistent hover states

### Testing Results
- ✅ Selected delivery app pills now have white background with dark text and border
- ✅ Styling matches the "Protein Source" pills and other form elements
- ✅ Hover states work correctly
- ✅ X icon for removal remains functional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ❌ Alignment issues remain (pills still not properly centered or flush to left edge)

### Prevention Measures
- Always test UI components against the design system
- Use consistent styling patterns across similar components
- Test alignment and spacing in different screen sizes
- Verify hover states and interactive elements work correctly

### Notes
- This fix ensures the multi-select component follows the established design system
- The styling now matches other form elements for consistency
- Alignment issues still need to be addressed in a future update
- The fix maintains all existing functionality while improving visual consistency

## [BUG-007] - Wishlist and My Dishes Functionality Not Working
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** Development Team

### Description
The wishlist and My Dishes pages were not functional due to missing API endpoints and incorrect filtering logic. Users could not save dishes to their wishlist, and the My Dishes page was not showing the correct dishes for the current user.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the homepage and click the bookmark icon on any dish
2. Navigate to the My Wishlist page - no dishes appear
3. Navigate to the My Dishes page - incorrect or no dishes appear
4. Refresh the page - bookmark state is lost

### Expected Behavior
- Bookmarking a dish should save it to the user's wishlist in the database
- My Wishlist page should display all saved dishes for the current user
- My Dishes page should display only dishes contributed by the current user
- Bookmark state should persist across page reloads and sessions

### Actual Behavior
- Bookmarking only updated local state, not the database
- My Wishlist page showed empty state with TODO comment
- My Dishes page filtered by user name instead of user ID
- Bookmark state was lost on page refresh

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/api/wishlist/route.ts` (new file)
  - `app/page.tsx`
  - `app/my-dishes/page.tsx`
  - `app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`

### Error Details
- **Root Cause**: Missing wishlist API endpoint and incorrect user filtering logic
- **Impact**: Core functionality broken, poor user experience

### Root Cause
1. **Missing Wishlist API**: No `/api/wishlist` endpoint existed to handle wishlist operations
2. **Local State Only**: Bookmark functionality only updated React state, not database
3. **Incorrect Filtering**: My Dishes page filtered by user name instead of user ID
4. **No Persistence**: Bookmark state was lost on page refresh

### Resolution Steps
1. **Created Wishlist API Endpoint** (`/api/wishlist/route.ts`):
   - **GET**: Fetch user's wishlist with full dish details
   - **POST**: Add dish to wishlist (with duplicate handling)
   - **DELETE**: Remove dish from wishlist
   - Added proper authentication and error handling
   - Used Supabase joins to fetch complete dish information

2. **Updated Homepage Bookmark Functionality** (`app/page.tsx`):
   - Modified `handleBookmarkToggle` to call wishlist API
   - Added `useEffect` to fetch user's wishlist on page load
   - Implemented proper error handling for API calls
   - Fixed TypeScript issues with Set types

3. **Fixed My Dishes Page Filtering** (`app/my-dishes/page.tsx`):
   - Changed filtering from `dish.addedBy === currentUser` to `dish.user_id === currentUserId`
   - Updated Dish interface to include `user_id` field
   - Fixed data transformation to include `user_id` and `delivery_apps`
   - Used `user?.id` instead of `user?.user_metadata?.name`

4. **Updated My Wishlist Page** (`app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`):
   - Replaced TODO with actual wishlist API call
   - Updated `handleBookmarkToggle` to call DELETE API
   - Added proper error handling and loading states
   - Fixed data fetching to use authenticated user

### Testing Results
- ✅ Bookmarking dishes saves to database and persists across page reloads
- ✅ My Wishlist page displays saved dishes correctly
- ✅ My Dishes page shows only current user's contributed dishes
- ✅ Bookmark state persists across browser sessions
- ✅ API endpoints return proper authentication errors for unauthenticated users
- ✅ No linting errors remain
- ✅ All pages load correctly with proper data

### Prevention Measures
- Always implement complete CRUD operations for user data
- Test data persistence across page navigation and browser sessions
- Use user ID for filtering instead of user names
- Implement proper API endpoints before building frontend functionality
- Test authentication and authorization for all API endpoints

### Notes
- This fix restores core functionality for wishlist and user dish management
- The wishlist API follows the same patterns as existing API endpoints
- All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow established patterns
- The application now provides a complete user experience for dish management

## [BUG-008] - Wishlist API Supabase Relationship Error
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** Development Team

### Description
The wishlist API was returning a PGRST201 error due to ambiguous relationship specification in the Supabase query. The error occurred because there are multiple relationships between `dishes` and `users` tables, and Supabase couldn't determine which relationship to use for the join.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the My Wishlist page
2. Observe the error message "Failed to load wishlist. Please try again later."
3. Check browser console for PGRST201 error
4. Try to bookmark a dish from the homepage - it appears to work but doesn't persist

### Expected Behavior
- My Wishlist page should load and display saved dishes
- Bookmarking dishes should persist to the database
- Bookmark state should remain consistent across page navigation

### Actual Behavior
- My Wishlist page shows error message
- Bookmarking appears to work but doesn't persist
- Bookmark state is lost when navigating between pages
- Console shows PGRST201 Supabase relationship error

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Error Code**: PGRST201
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/api/wishlist/route.ts`
  - `app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`

### Error Details
```
Error fetching wishlist: {
  code: 'PGRST201',
  details: [
    {
      cardinality: 'many-to-one',
      embedding: 'dishes with users',
      relationship: 'dishes_user_id_fkey using dishes(user_id) and users(id)'
    },
    {
      cardinality: 'many-to-many',
      embedding: 'dishes with users',
      relationship: 'wishlist_items using wishlist_items_dish_id_fkey(dish_id) and wishlist_items_user_id_fkey(user_id)'
    }
  ],
  hint: "Try changing 'users' to one of the following: 'users!dishes_user_id_fkey', 'users!wishlist_items'. Find the desired relationship in the 'details' key.",
  message: "Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'dishes' and 'users'"
}
```

### Root Cause
The Supabase query in the wishlist API was using an ambiguous relationship specification. When selecting from `wishlist_items` and joining with `dishes`, then trying to embed `users`, Supabase found multiple possible relationships:
1. `dishes_user_id_fkey` - the relationship between dishes and their creators
2. `wishlist_items` - the many-to-many relationship through the junction table

Supabase couldn't determine which relationship to use for the `users` embedding.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Fixed Supabase Query** in `/api/wishlist/route.ts`:
   - Changed `users (name)` to `users!dishes_user_id_fkey (name)`
   - This explicitly specifies which relationship to use for the join
   - Uses the `dishes_user_id_fkey` relationship to get the dish creator's name

2. **Updated Error Message** in `app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`:
   - Removed "Using sample data for now." text
   - Updated to more appropriate error message: "Please check your internet connection or try again later."

### Additional Issue Found
After fixing the PGRST201 error, a new issue was discovered:

**Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Violation:**
```
Error adding to wishlist: {
  code: '42501',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "wishlist_items"'
}
```

**Root Cause:** The `wishlist_items` table has RLS enabled but no policy allowing authenticated users to insert their own wishlist items.

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ GET /api/wishlist works (200 status)
- ❌ POST /api/wishlist fails (500 status) due to RLS policy
- ❌ Bookmarking doesn't persist to database
- ❌ Bookmark state is lost on page refresh

### Testing Results
- ✅ My Wishlist page loads without errors (GET works)
- ❌ Bookmarking dishes fails to persist to database (POST blocked by RLS)
- ❌ Bookmark state is lost on page refresh
- ✅ API returns proper data structure for GET requests
- ✅ No more PGRST201 errors in console
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly

### Prevention Measures
- Always specify explicit relationship names in Supabase queries when multiple relationships exist
- Test API endpoints with actual data to catch relationship ambiguities
- Use Supabase's relationship hints when errors occur
- Verify that joins work correctly with the database schema

### Final Resolution Steps
1. **Created RLS Policies** for `wishlist_items` table:
   ```sql
   -- Enable RLS on wishlist_items table
   ALTER TABLE wishlist_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Policy 1: Allow users to SELECT their own wishlist items
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own wishlist items" ON wishlist_items
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

   -- Policy 2: Allow users to INSERT their own wishlist items
   CREATE POLICY "Users can add to their own wishlist" ON wishlist_items
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

   -- Policy 3: Allow users to DELETE their own wishlist items
   CREATE POLICY "Users can remove from their own wishlist" ON wishlist_items
       FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

2. **Verified Complete Workflow**:
   - ✅ Bookmark dish from homepage works
   - ✅ Dish appears in My Wishlist page
   - ✅ Bookmark state persists across page refreshes
   - ✅ Removing items from wishlist works

### Final Testing Results
- ✅ My Wishlist page loads without errors
- ✅ Bookmarking dishes persists to database
- ✅ Bookmark state remains consistent across page navigation
- ✅ API returns proper data structure for all operations
- ✅ No more PGRST201 errors in console
- ✅ No more RLS policy violation errors
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly
- ✅ Complete wishlist functionality working end-to-end

### Notes
- The PGRST201 relationship error has been fixed
- The explicit relationship specification ensures consistent query behavior
- The error message update improves user experience
- **RLS policies have been created and are working correctly**
- **Bug status is now "Resolved" after user verification confirms complete functionality**

## [BUG-009] - Edit Dish Form Field Order Inconsistency
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** Medium (UX)
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** User

### Description
The edit dish form had a different field order compared to the add dish form, creating inconsistency in the user experience. Users would expect the same field order when editing a dish as when adding a new dish.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Add Dish page
2. Observe the field order: Source Type → Restaurant Name → Dish Name → Protein Source → Photo → Ratings → Comments
3. Navigate to My Dishes page and click Edit on any dish
4. Observe the different field order: Dish Name → Restaurant Name → City → Price → Protein Source → Availability → Delivery Apps → Ratings → Comments

### Expected Behavior
- Edit dish form should have the same field order as the add dish form
- Users should have a consistent experience when adding or editing dishes
- Field order should follow the logical flow: Source Type → Restaurant Name → Dish Name → Protein Source → Ratings → Comments

### Actual Behavior
- Edit dish form had a completely different field order
- Field order was: Dish Name → Restaurant Name → City → Price → Protein Source → Availability → Delivery Apps → Ratings → Comments
- This created confusion and inconsistency in the user experience

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/edit-dish/[id]/page.tsx`

### Error Details
- **Root Cause**: Edit form was implemented with a different field order than the add form
- **Impact**: Inconsistent user experience, confusion when switching between add and edit forms

### Root Cause
The edit dish form was implemented independently from the add dish form, resulting in a different field order. The developer didn't follow the established field order from the add dish form.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Analyzed Add Dish Form Field Order**:
   - Source Type (In-Restaurant/Online)
   - Restaurant Name (conditional on source type)
   - Delivery Apps (Online only)
   - Dish Name
   - Protein Source
   - Photo
   - Taste
   - Protein Content
   - Price
   - Overall Satisfaction
   - Comments

2. **Reordered Edit Dish Form Fields** to match add dish form:
   - Moved Availability (Source Type) to the top
   - Moved Delivery Apps to immediately follow Availability
   - Moved Price into the ratings section
   - Removed City field (hardcoded in add form)
   - Updated form state and validation to remove city references

3. **Updated Form State Management**:
   - Removed `city` state variable and related logic
   - Updated data submission to use original city value
   - Updated validation to remove city requirements

### Testing Results
- ✅ Edit dish form now matches add dish form field order
- ✅ Conditional fields (Delivery Apps) appear in correct position
- ✅ Form validation and submission logic unchanged
- ✅ No linting errors remain
- ✅ User experience is now consistent between add and edit forms

### Prevention Measures
- Always follow established patterns when creating similar forms
- Test form consistency across different user flows
- Use the same field order for related forms to maintain user experience
- Review form layouts for consistency during development

### Notes
- This fix ensures consistent user experience across add and edit forms
- The field order now follows the logical flow established in the add dish form
- All functionality remains intact while improving user experience
- The fix maintains all existing validation and submission logic

**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** User

### Description
Invite codes were not showing up on the account settings page due to missing RLS policies on the `invite_codes` table. Users could not view their generated invite codes, and the account page showed "No invite codes available" even when codes existed.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Account page
2. Observe that no invite codes are displayed
3. Check browser console for 401 errors
4. Verify that invite codes exist in the database but are not accessible

### Expected Behavior
- Account page should display all user's invite codes (both used and unused)
- Used codes should be visually distinguished from unused codes
- Copy functionality should work for available codes
- Status indicators should clearly show code availability

### Actual Behavior
- Account page showed "No invite codes available"
- API calls to `/api/invite-codes` returned 401 errors
- Users could not view or manage their invite codes
- No visual status indicators for code usage

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development

GET /api/invite-codes 401 in 44ms
{"error":"You are not authorized."}
```

### Root Cause
The `invite_codes` table had RLS enabled but no policies allowing authenticated users to access their own invite codes. This caused all API calls to return 401 errors.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Created RLS Policies** for `invite_codes` table:
   ```sql
   -- Enable RLS on invite_codes table
   ALTER TABLE invite_codes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Policy 1: Allow users to SELECT their own invite codes (both used and unused)
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own invite codes" ON invite_codes
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = generated_by_user_id);

   -- Policy 2: Allow system to INSERT invite codes for users
   CREATE POLICY "System can create invite codes for users" ON invite_codes
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = generated_by_user_id);

   -- Policy 3: Allow system to UPDATE invite codes (mark as used)
   CREATE POLICY "System can update invite codes" ON invite_codes
       FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = generated_by_user_id);
   ```

2. **Updated Invite Codes API** (`/api/invite-codes/route.ts`):
   - Removed `is_used: false` filter to return all codes (used and unused)
   - Updated comment to reflect new behavior
   - Maintained existing functionality for signup flow

3. **Enhanced Account Page UI** (`app/account/page.tsx`):

   - Added proper styling with `bg-muted/50 opacity-75` for used codes

### Testing Results
- ✅ Account page displays all invite codes with correct status
- ✅ Used codes are grayed out with "Used" label
- ✅ Unused codes show "Available" label with active copy button
- ✅ Copy functionality works for available codes
- ✅ No 401 errors on invite codes API
- ✅ RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ Signup flow remains unaffected
- ✅ No linting errors remain

### Prevention Measures
- Always implement RLS policies when enabling RLS on tables
- Test API endpoints with actual data to catch access issues
- Verify that joins work correctly with the database schema
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated access scenarios

### Notes
- The RLS policies ensure secure access to invite codes
- The visual status indicators improve user experience
- The API now returns all codes for better account management
- The signup flow remains completely unaffected by these changes

- **User Role:** N/A

### Error Details
```
Module not found: Can't resolve './/fonts/RethinkSans-Regular.woff2'
Failed to find font override values for font `Rethink Sans`
```

### Root Cause
1. **Incorrect font file downloads**: GitHub repository URLs were returning HTML redirects instead of actual WOFF2 font files
2. **Wrong implementation approach**: Attempted to use localFont with files that weren't properly formatted
3. **Project structure confusion**: Created fonts in wrong directory initially

### Resolution Steps
1. **Switched to Google Fonts approach**:
   - Removed incorrect local font files
   - Updated `app/layout.tsx` to use `Rethink_Sans` from `next/font/google`
   - Configured font weights: 400, 500, 600, 700, 800

2. **Updated font configuration**:
   ```typescript
   const rethinkSans = Rethink_Sans({
     subsets: ["latin"],
     weight: ["400", "500", "600", "700", "800"],
     variable: '--font-rethink-sans',
     display: 'swap',
   })
   ```

3. **Updated CSS variables** (`app/globals.css`):
   - Changed `--font-sans` to use `var(--font-rethink-sans)`

4. **Updated Tailwind config** (`tailwind.config.ts`):
   - Added font family configuration for Rethink Sans

5. **Enhanced app title styling** (`components/header.tsx`):
   - Added responsive sizing: `text-3xl sm:text-2xl`
   - Maintained `font-extrabold` (800 weight) and `uppercase`

6. **Normalized letter spacing** across all components:
   - Removed `tracking-tight`, `tracking-tighter`, `tracking-widest` classes
   - Updated: `header.tsx`, `signup/page.tsx`, `complete-profile/page.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `command.tsx`

### Testing Results
- ✅ App compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ Rethink Sans font loads correctly via Google Fonts
- ✅ Font is applied consistently across the application

## [BUG-012] - Search Results Dropdown Overflow and Placeholder Truncation Issues
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** Medium (UX)
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** User

### Description
Multiple UI issues in the Add Dish form's restaurant search functionality:
1. Search results dropdown was overflowing the form container boundaries
2. Restaurant names were truncated with "..." instead of showing full text
3. Placeholder text "Search for Restaurant" was being cut off to "Search for Restaur"
4. Long restaurant names like "Yolkshire PYC Hindu Gymkhana (Members-Exclusive)" were cut short

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Add Dish page
2. Select "In-Restaurant" source type
3. Type in restaurant search field and observe dropdown results
4. Notice truncated restaurant names and placeholder text issues
5. Check on both mobile and desktop viewports

### Expected Behavior
- Search dropdown should stay within form boundaries
- Full restaurant names should be visible with proper text wrapping
- Placeholder text should display completely
- Layout should work properly on all screen sizes

### Actual Behavior
- Search dropdown overflowed form container
- Restaurant names were truncated with ellipsis (...)
- Placeholder text was cut off mid-word
- Inconsistent experience across devices

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/add-dish/page.tsx`
  - `components/ui/restaurant-search-input.tsx`

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Container Constraints**: `max-w-2xl` (672px) was too restrictive for content width
2. **Inadequate Padding**: Fixed `px-6` padding didn't account for responsive needs
3. **Text Truncation**: Using `truncate` class instead of proper text wrapping
4. **Input Field Width**: Insufficient right padding for Search button and placeholder text

### Resolution Steps
1. **Fixed Container Constraints** in `app/add-dish/page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Before: max-w-2xl mx-auto py-8 px-6
   // After: max-w-full mx-auto py-8 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8
   ```

2. **Optimized Input Field** in `components/ui/restaurant-search-input.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Changed placeholder to shorter version
   placeholder="Search for restaurant"  // Was "Search for Restaurant"
   
   // Increased right padding for Search button
   className="pl-10 pr-24"  // Was "pl-10 pr-20"
   
   // Improved Search button padding
   className="absolute right-2 top-1/2 transform -translate-y-1/2 h-6 px-3 text-xs"
   ```

3. **Fixed Dropdown Containers**:
   ```typescript
   // Added max-w-none to prevent width constraints
   <Card className="absolute z-50 w-full mt-1 border shadow-lg bg-background max-w-none">
   
   // Changed from truncate to break-words
   <div className="font-medium text-sm break-words">
   <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground break-words">
   ```

### Technical Details
- **Responsive Design**: Used Tailwind's responsive padding classes (`sm:px-6 lg:px-8`)
- **Text Wrapping**: Replaced `truncate` with `break-words` for better UX
- **Container Optimization**: Changed from fixed `max-w-2xl` to flexible `max-w-full`
- **Typography**: Used `break-words` to handle long restaurant names gracefully

### Testing Results
- ✅ Dropdown stays within form boundaries on all screen sizes
- ✅ Full restaurant names display with proper text wrapping
- ✅ Placeholder text displays completely ("Search for restaurant")
- ✅ Long restaurant names like "Yolkshire PYC Hindu Gymkhana (Members-Exclusive)" display fully
- ✅ Mobile layout works correctly with responsive padding
- ✅ Desktop layout utilizes full available width
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Prevention Measures

## [BUG-012-RESOLVED] - Search Results Dropdown Overflow and Placeholder Truncation Issues - FIXED
**Resolution Date:** 2025-01-30
**Status:** ✅ Completely Resolved

### Final Resolution Summary
**Issue 1: Dropdown Overflow Fixed**
- **Root Cause**: Dropdown was constrained by parent container (`div.relative`)
- **Solution**: Implemented React Portal (`createPortal`) to render dropdown at `document.body` level
- **Implementation**: Dynamic positioning using `getBoundingClientRect()` with absolute coordinates
- **Result**: Dropdown now extends beyond any container boundaries properly

**Issue 2: Placeholder Text Truncation Fixed** 
- **Root Cause**: `pr-24` (96px) padding applied even when Search button wasn't visible
- **Solution**: Dynamic conditional padding - only apply `pr-20` when Search button is shown
- **Implementation**: `className={pl-10 ${value &= !selectedRestaurant ? 'pr-20' : ''}}`
- **Result**: Placeholder "Search for restaurant" displays completely

### Technical Implementation Details
```typescript
// Dynamic padding solution
className={`pl-10 ${value && !selectedRestaurant ? 'pr-20' : ''}`}

// Portal with dynamic positioning
{createPortal(
  <Card 
    className="absolute z-[9999] border shadow-lg bg-background"
    style={{
      top: dropdownPosition.top,
      left: dropdownPosition.left,
      width: dropdownPosition.width
    }}
  >
    {/* Dropdown content */}
  </Card>,
  document.body
)}
```

### Final Testing Results
- ✅ Dropdown escapes container constraints with Portal rendering
- ✅ Placeholder text displays completely (`"Search for restaurant"`)
- ✅ Search button only adds padding when actually visible
- ✅ Long restaurant names wrap properly with `break-words`
- ✅ Positioning works correctly on all screen sizes
- ✅ High z-index (`z-[9999]`) ensures dropdown appears above everything
- ✅ Portal cleanup handled automatically by React

## [BUG-013] - Restaurant Selection Not Updating Input Field
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** User

### Description
When users click on a restaurant from the search results dropdown, the dropdown closes as expected but the input field continues to show the typed text instead of the selected restaurant's name. This occurs because the input value was being set to `prediction.description` (full address) instead of the restaurant name, creating a confusion between what's displayed and what's expected.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Add Dish page
2. Select "In-Restaurant" source type
3. Type "yolkshi" in restaurant search field
4. Click on any restaurant from the search results dropdown
5. Observe that input field still shows "yolkshi" instead of restaurant name

### Expected Behavior
- Input field should immediately show the selected restaurant's name
- Restaurant selection should persist across page navigation
- Complete restaurant data (name, address, coordinates) should be captured
- Form submission should include all restaurant location data

### Actual Behavior
- Input field continued to show user's typed text
- No visual feedback that restaurant was selected
- User couldn't verify which restaurant was actually selected
- Potential loss of restaurant details during form submission

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `components/ui/restaurant-search-input.tsx`

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrong Input Value**: Line 115 was setting `inputValue` to `prediction.description` (full address)
2. **Data Type Mismatch**: Input should show restaurant name, not full description
3. **Async Timing**: UI update occurred before API call completion
4. **Missing Error Handling**: No fallback if detailed restaurant search failed
5. **State Confusion**: Multiple state updates happening asynchronously

### Resolution Steps
1. **Fixed Input Value Update**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: const inputValue = prediction.description
   // After: const restaurantName = prediction.structured_formatting.main_text
   const restaurantName = prediction.structured_formatting.main_text
   onChange(restaurantName)
   ```

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive try/catch with fallback data
   - Implemented graceful degradation when API calls fail
   - Added logging for debugging restaurant selection flow
   - Ensured `onSelect()` always receives valid restaurant data

3. **Improved Async Flow**:
   - Immediate UI update with restaurant name
   - Background API call for complete restaurant details
   - Fallback to autocomplete data if detailed search fails
   - Consistent state management throughout the process

4. **Robust Fallback System**:
   ```typescript
   const fallbackRestaurant: RestaurantResult = {
     place_id: prediction.place_id,
     name: prediction.structured_formatting.main_text,
     formatted_address: prediction.description,
     geometry: {
       location: { lat: 0, lng: 0 }, // Placeholder coordinates
     },
   }
   ```

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Input Value Management**: Uses restaurant name instead of full description

## [BUG-014] - Invite Code System Failing During Signup (RESOLVED)
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** Critical (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Reporter:** User

### Description
The invite code validation system was completely broken, preventing new users from signing up. Users could enter valid invite codes but the signup API would return 404 errors, blocking the entire user onboarding flow.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the signup page
2. Enter a valid unused invite code (e.g., "HYPEREL2P")
3. Enter a phone number (e.g., "999999999999")
4. Click "Send OTP"
5. Observe 404 error instead of OTP being sent

### Expected Behavior
- Invite code should be validated successfully
- OTP should be sent to the phone number
- User should proceed to verification step
- Invite code should be marked as used only after successful profile completion

### Actual Behavior
- Signup API returned 404 errors
- Invite code validation completely failed
- No OTP was sent
- User onboarding was completely blocked

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Error Code**: 404 (Not Found)
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`
  - `lib/supabase/service.ts` (new file)
  - Database RLS policies

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue had multiple layers of complexity:

1. **Legacy Service Role Key Issue**: Original implementation attempted to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` but this environment variable was not configured.

2. **RLS Policy Blocking Access**: The `invite_codes` table had RLS enabled with policy `auth.uid() = generated_by_user_id`, which prevented unauthenticated users from reading invite codes during signup validation.

3. **Modern API Key Migration**: During troubleshooting, we discovered Supabase's migration to modern Secret API keys (`sb_secret_...`) replacing legacy service role keys.

4. **Environment Variable Confusion**: Multiple different environment variable names were suggested (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, `SECRET_API_KEY`) requiring clarification.

### Resolution Steps

#### 1. **Modern Secret API Key Implementation**
- Created new `lib/supabase/service.ts` with `createServiceClient()` function
- Used modern Secret API key (`SUPABASE_SECRET_API_KEY`) instead of legacy service role
- Implemented proper error handling for missing environment variables
- Added browser blocking protection (Secret API keys return 401 if used in browser)

#### 2. **Service Client Configuration**
```typescript
// lib/supabase/service.ts
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js"

export function createServiceClient() {
  const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!
  const supabaseSecretKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SECRET_API_KEY
  
  if (!supabaseSecretKey) {
    throw new Error("SUPABASE_SECRET_API_KEY environment variable is not set. Please add it to your .env.local file.")
  }
  
  return createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseSecretKey, {
    auth: {
      autoRefreshToken: false,
      persistSession: false,
    },
  })
}
```

#### 3. **Signup API Security Enhancement**
- Updated `/api/auth/signup/route.ts` to use service client for invite code validation
- Maintained authentication bypass only for specific invite code validation step
- Preserved RLS policies for regular operations
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

#### 4. **Missing Database Policy Fix**
- Identified missing INSERT policy on `users` table preventing profile creation
- Provided SQL policy for manual execution:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to insert their own profile" ON public.users
FOR INSERT 
TO public
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

#### 5. **Clean State Management**
- Identified orphaned user in `auth.users` table
- Provided cleanup instructions for database hygiene
- Ensured clean testing environment

### Environment Variable Setup
**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Modern Secret API key (replaces legacy service role key)
SUPABASE_SECRET_API_KEY=sb_secret_[secret_api_key_from_dashboard]

# Keep existing variables (unchanged)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_existing_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_existing_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
```

### Security Analysis
**Secret API Key vs Legacy Service Role:**
- ✅ **Better Security**: Browser blocking protection
- ✅ **Zero-Downtime Rotation**: Keys can be rotated without app downtime
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Better tracking and monitoring
- ✅ **Modern Architecture**: Built for new Supabase API Gateway
- ✅ **Independently Managed**: Keys managed separately from other components

**Security Considerations:**
- Secret API key is only used in a backend environment (safe)
- Bypass RLS only for invite code validation during signup (minimal scope)
- Maintained secure flow for all other operations
- Proper error handling prevents sensitive data exposure

### Testing Results
- ✅ Invite code validation works correctly via Secret API key
- ✅ OTP sending functionality restored
- ✅ Complete signup flow operational
- ✅ Database bypass limited to invite code validation only
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ Service client properly configured with error handling
- ✅ Environment variable validation works correctly
- ✅ End-to-end user onboarding confirmed working

### Final Verification
**Signup Flow Testing:**
1. ✅ Phone validation: Success
2. ✅ Invite code validation: Success (using Secret API key)
3. ✅ OTP verification: Success
4. ✅ Profile completion: Success (with INSERT policy fix)
5. ✅ Invite code marked as used: Success
6. ✅ New user created in both `auth.users` and `public.users`: Success

**User Confirmation:** User successfully tested the complete signup flow with phone number 999999999999 using invite code "HYPEREL2P". System working correctly.

### Prevention Measures
- Always test invite code validation during development
- Verify environment variable setup before production
- Test authentication flows end-to-end

## [FEATURE-005] - OTP Rate Limiting Implementation
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Component:** Authentication System

### Description
Implemented comprehensive rate limiting for OTP requests to prevent abuse and control costs. The system limits the number of OTP requests per phone number within a specified time window, protecting against malicious usage while maintaining a smooth user experience for legitimate users.

### Problem Statement
- **Cost Concern**: OTP messages cost money per SMS (~$0.01-0.02 per message)
- **Abuse Risk**: Malicious users could repeatedly request OTPs for the same number
- **Scale Impact**: With growth, uncontrolled OTP requests could result in significant costs
- **User Experience**: Need to balance security with legitimate user needs

### Implementation Details

#### 1. **Rate Limiting Utility** (`lib/rate-limit.ts`)
- **In-Memory Storage**: Uses JavaScript Map for fast access and automatic cleanup
- **Configurable Limits**: Separate limits for signup (3 requests/15min) and login (5 requests/15min)
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages with exact retry times
- **Helper Functions**: Debugging and testing utilities

#### 2. **Signup API Protection** (`app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`)
- **Rate Limit**: 3 OTP requests per 15 minutes per phone number
- **Error Message**: "Too many signup attempts. Please try again in X minutes."
- **Status Code**: 429 (Too Many Requests)

#### 3. **Login API Protection** (`app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- **Rate Limit**: 5 OTP requests per 15 minutes per phone number
- **Error Message**: "Too many login attempts. Please try again in X minutes."
- **Status Code**: 429 (Too Many Requests)

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Rate limiting check before sending OTP
const rateLimitResult = checkRateLimit(phone, 3, 15 * 60 * 1000);

if (!rateLimitResult.allowed) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: `Too many signup attempts. Please try again in ${resetTime}.`
  }, { status: 429 });
}
```

### Cost Protection Analysis

**Before Rate Limiting:**
- Malicious user: 1000+ OTP requests = $20+ in costs
- Legitimate user: 3-5 requests = $0.06-0.10

**After Rate Limiting:**
- Malicious user: **Maximum 3 signup + 5 login = 8 requests per 15 minutes = $0.16**
- Legitimate user: **Same 3-5 requests = $0.06-0.10**
- **Cost protection: 99%+ reduction in abuse scenarios**

### User Experience Impact
- ✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Users know exactly when they can try again
- ✅ **Separate Limits**: Different limits for signup vs login (more generous for login)
- ✅ **15-Minute Windows**: Reasonable for legitimate users, effective against abuse
- ✅ **No Impact on Normal Usage**: Legitimate users won't hit these limits

### Testing Results
- ✅ Rate limiting logic tested and working correctly
- ✅ Request 1-3: Allowed (2, 1, 0 remaining)
- ✅ Request 4+: Blocked (0 remaining)
- ✅ Different phone numbers have separate limits
- ✅ Reset time formatting works correctly
- ✅ No linting errors introduced

### Prevention Measures
- **In-Memory Storage**: Fast and simple for MVP scale
- **Configurable Limits**: Easy to adjust limits based on usage patterns
- **Clear Documentation**: Well-documented utility functions for future maintenance
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear communication about retry times

### Future Considerations
- **Database Persistence**: Could move to database-based rate limiting for multi-server deployments
- **IP-Based Limiting**: Could add IP-based rate limiting for additional protection
- **Dynamic Limits**: Could implement dynamic limits based on user behavior patterns
- **Analytics**: Could add monitoring for rate limit hits to identify abuse patterns

### Security Benefits
- ✅ **Cost Control**: Prevents unlimited OTP abuse
- ✅ **Resource Protection**: Protects Supabase Auth quotas
- ✅ **User Protection**: Prevents spam attacks on phone numbers
- ✅ **Business Protection**: Predictable OTP costs

### Notes
- This implementation provides robust protection against OTP abuse while maintaining excellent user experience
- The rate limiting is transparent to legitimate users and only affects malicious usage
- Cost protection is significant (99%+ reduction in abuse scenarios)
- The system is ready for production deployment with predictable OTP costs

## BUG-006 - Homepage Loading State Issue for Unauthenticated Users
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** Development Team

### Description
The homepage (Discover page) was stuck in infinite loading state for non-logged-in users, showing "Loading..." message indefinitely and preventing dishes from displaying.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log out of the application
2. Navigate to homepage (/)
3. Observe infinite "Loading..." message
4. Notice no dishes are displayed

### Expected Behavior
Non-logged-in users should see dishes from all cities with default greeting "Hey User! 👋"

### Actual Behavior
Homepage shows "Loading..." indefinitely, no dishes visible

### Environment
- **Browser:** Any
- **Device:** Mobile/Desktop
- **App Version:** Current development version
- **User Role:** Not logged in

### Root Cause
The `fetchUserProfile` useEffect in `app/page.tsx` was guarded by `if (user)` condition. For unauthenticated users:
- `loadingProfile` state remained `true` forever
- `fetchUserProfile` never executed
- No default values were set for username/city
- UI remained in loading state

### Resolution
Modified `app/page.tsx` to handle unauthenticated users:
```typescript
if (user) {
  fetchUserProfile()
} else {
  // For unauthenticated users, set default values and stop loading
  setUserName("User")
  setUserCity("Mumbai") 
  setLoadingProfile(false)
}
```

Also updated greeting message logic:
```typescript
{loadingProfile 
  ? "Loading..." 
  : user 
    ? `Discover high-protein meals in ${userCity}` 
    : "Discover high-protein meals from restaurants everywhere"
}
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Unauthenticated users see default greeting
- ✅ All dishes display properly (no city filtering)
- ✅ Loading state resolves immediately
- ✅ Authenticated users unaffected
