## [BUG-002] - Phone Number Exposure in User Profile API

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-002
- **Title**: Phone Number Exposure in User Profile API
- **Severity**: High (Security)
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2024-12-19
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The GET `/api/users` endpoint returns all user fields including sensitive phone numbers, creating a security vulnerability where phone numbers are exposed to the frontend and potentially logged or cached.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Navigate to any page that fetches user profile data (homepage, account page)
4. Check the Network tab for GET `/api/users` requests
5. Observe that the response includes the `phone` field

### Expected Behavior
- The API should only return safe, non-sensitive user data (id, name, city, created_at)
- Phone numbers should never be exposed in API responses
- User names should display correctly on the homepage

### Actual Behavior
- The API returns all user fields including `phone` number
- Phone numbers are exposed in API responses
- This creates a security vulnerability

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **API Endpoint**: GET `/api/users`
- **Current Implementation**: Uses `.select("*")` which returns all fields
- **Security Issue**: Phone numbers included in response

### Root Cause
The GET handler in `/api/users/route.ts` uses `.select("*")` instead of selecting only the necessary fields, exposing sensitive data.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Update GET /api/users endpoint** to select only safe fields:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of .select("*")
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from("users")
     .select("id, name, city, created_at")
     .eq("id", user.id)
     .single();
   ```

2. **Test the fix** to ensure:
   - Phone numbers are no longer exposed
   - User names still display correctly on homepage
   - Account page functionality remains intact

3. **Verify no breaking changes** to:
   - Login/signup process
   - Profile creation
   - Other API endpoints

### Prevention Measures
- Implement field selection best practices for all API endpoints
- Add security review checklist for sensitive data exposure
- Consider implementing API response validation

### Testing
- [x] Verify phone numbers are not exposed in API responses
- [x] Test homepage displays user names correctly
- [x] Test account page functionality
- [x] Verify login/signup process unaffected
- [x] Test profile creation process

### Notes
- This is a simple fix that doesn't require database schema changes
- Phone numbers remain stored in the database for authentication purposes
- Only the API response needs to be secured

## [BUG-004] - Client-Side Sorting Performance Limitation

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-004
- **Title**: Client-Side Sorting Performance Limitation
- **Severity**: Medium (Performance)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Deferred to V2
- **Date Reported**: 2025-01-30
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
Current price sorting is implemented client-side, which will not scale well with large datasets. All dishes are fetched from the database and sorted in the browser, causing performance issues as the database grows.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the homepage
2. Use the "Sort by Price" dropdown
3. Select "Price: Low to High" or "Price: High to Low"
4. Observe that sorting happens in the browser after all data is loaded

### Expected Behavior
- Sorting should be performed at the database level for optimal performance
- Only relevant data should be fetched based on filters and sorting
- Large datasets should not impact browser performance

### Actual Behavior
- All dishes are fetched from the database regardless of sorting preference
- Sorting is performed client-side using JavaScript
- Browser performance degrades with large datasets

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **Component**: Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Current Implementation**: Client-side sorting in lines 191-212
- **API Endpoint**: GET `/api/dishes` returns all dishes
- **Performance Issue**: O(n log n) sorting in browser vs O(n) database sorting

### Root Cause
The current implementation prioritizes MVP functionality over performance optimization. Client-side sorting was chosen for simplicity and rapid development, but it doesn't scale with database growth.

### Current Implementation
```typescript
// Client-side sorting in app/page.tsx (lines 191-212)
const filteredDishes = dishes
  .filter((dish) => {
    const cityMatch = dish.city === userCity
    const proteinMatch = selectedProteinFilter === "All" || dish.protein_source === selectedProteinFilter
    return cityMatch && proteinMatch
  })
  .sort((a, b) => {
    // Price parsing and sorting logic
    const parsePrice = (p: string | undefined) => {
      if (!p) return NaN
      const n = Number(String(p).replace(/[^0-9.]/g, ""))
      return isNaN(n) ? NaN : n
    }
    // ... sorting logic
  })
```

### Future Solution
- **Server-Side Sorting**: Use Supabase's built-in sorting capabilities
- **Database Indexing**: Add indexes on price, city, and protein_source columns
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large result sets
- **Query Optimization**: Use Supabase client for direct database queries

## [FEATURE-001] - Add Restaurant Name Field to Online Dish Form
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Add Dish Form

### Description
The online dish form was missing a restaurant name field, which is essential for identifying where the dish was found. Users could only select a delivery app and provide a URL, but not specify the restaurant name.

### Root Cause
The form implementation only captured restaurant names for "In-Restaurant" dishes but not for "Online" dishes, despite the database schema supporting restaurant names for both types.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Added State Management**
   - Added `onlineRestaurant` state variable to track restaurant name for online dishes
   - Updated form validation to require restaurant name for online dishes

2. **Updated Form UI**
   - Added restaurant name input field in the online section
   - Positioned between delivery app selection and URL input
   - Used placeholder "Enter Outlet Name" as requested
   - Made field required for online dishes

3. **Updated Data Submission**
   - Modified `dishData` object to use `onlineRestaurant` for online dishes
   - Maintained existing `restaurant` state for in-restaurant dishes
   - Added validation to prevent submission without restaurant name

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Added state variable
const [onlineRestaurant, setOnlineRestaurant] = useState("")

// Added validation
if (sourceType === "Online" && !onlineRestaurant) {
  alert("Restaurant name is required for online dishes.");
  return;
}

// Updated data submission
restaurant_name: sourceType === "Online" ? onlineRestaurant : restaurant,

// Added form field
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label htmlFor="onlineRestaurant">Restaurant Name</Label>
  <Input
    id="onlineRestaurant"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Enter Outlet Name"
    value={onlineRestaurant}
    onChange={(e) => setOnlineRestaurant(e.target.value)}
    required
  />
</div>
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form validation works correctly for online dishes
- ✅ Restaurant name is properly captured and submitted
- ✅ UI follows existing design patterns
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can now properly identify restaurants for online dishes
- **Data Quality**: Improved data completeness for online dish entries
- **Consistency**: Both in-restaurant and online dishes now capture restaurant names

## [FEATURE-002] - Make URL Field Optional in Online Dish Form
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Add Dish Form

### Description
The "Paste Link to Dish" field in the online dish form was marked as required, but users should be able to submit dishes without providing a URL. This field should be optional to improve user experience and reduce friction in dish submission.

### Root Cause
The form field had the `required` attribute and no visual indication that it was optional, making it mandatory for users to provide a URL even when they might not have one readily available.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Updated Form Field**
   - Removed `required` attribute from the URL input field
   - Updated label to include "(Optional)" to clearly indicate the field is not mandatory
   - Maintained URL input type for validation when a value is provided

2. **Verified Data Handling**
   - Confirmed API already handles empty URLs with `dishLink || null`
   - Verified database schema supports nullable URL fields
   - No changes needed to backend data processing

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Updated label
<Label htmlFor="dishLink">Paste Link to Dish (Optional)</Label>

// Updated input field (removed required attribute)
<Input
  id="dishLink"
  type="url"
  placeholder="https://..."
  value={dishLink}
  onChange={(e) => setDishLink(e.target.value)}
  // required attribute removed
/>
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form can be submitted without URL
- ✅ URL validation still works when provided
- ✅ Clear visual indication that field is optional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Reduced friction in dish submission process
- **Flexibility**: Users can add dishes without needing to find URLs
- **Data Quality**: Still captures URLs when available for better discoverability

## [FEATURE-003] - Remove URL Field and Add Delivery App Display
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Component:** Add Dish Form, Dish Card

### Description
Most delivery apps (except Zomato) don't provide direct links to specific dishes, making the URL field unnecessary. Additionally, users wanted to see the specific delivery app name in the dish card instead of generic "Online" text, and have buttons that open the specific delivery app.

### Root Cause
1. URL field was capturing data that wasn't useful for most delivery apps
2. Dish cards showed generic "Online" text instead of specific app names
3. Buttons showed generic "View on Delivery App" text instead of specific app names
4. No deep linking functionality to open specific delivery apps

### Resolution Steps
1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Added `delivery_app_name` column to `dishes` table
   - Updated API to store and return delivery app names

2. **Form Updates**
   - Removed URL input field from online dish form
   - Removed `dishLink` state and related logic
   - Updated form submission to include `delivery_app_name`
   - Set `delivery_app_url` to always null

3. **Dish Card Updates**
   - Added `deliveryAppName` prop to `DishCardProps`
   - Updated pill display to show specific app name instead of "Online"
   - Updated button text to show "Open [App Name]" instead of "View on Delivery App"
   - Implemented deep linking functionality for mobile and web

4. **Deep Linking Implementation**
   - Added deep link mappings for Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats, DoorDash
   - Implemented mobile detection and app opening logic
   - Added fallback to web versions when apps aren't installed
   - Used 1-second timeout for deep link failure detection

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Form submission updates
const dishData = {
  // ... existing fields
  delivery_app_name: sourceType === "Online" ? deliveryApp : null,
  delivery_app_url: null, // Always null since we removed URL field
};

// Dish card updates
interface DishCardProps {
  // ... existing props
  deliveryAppName?: string | null;
}

// Pill display
{availability === "Online" ? deliveryAppName || "Online" : availability}

// Button text and action
<Button onClick={handleDeliveryAppClick}>
  <Link className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Open {deliveryAppName || "Delivery App"}
</Button>

// Deep linking logic
const deliveryAppDeepLinks = {
  "Swiggy": { mobile: "swiggy://", web: "https://www.swiggy.com" },
  "Zomato": { mobile: "zomato://", web: "https://www.zomato.com" },
  "Uber Eats": { mobile: "uber://", web: "https://www.ubereats.com" },
  "DoorDash": { mobile: "doordash://", web: "https://www.doordash.com" }
};
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Form submission works without URL field
- ✅ Delivery app names display correctly in dish cards
- ✅ Deep linking works on mobile devices
- ✅ Web fallback works on desktop
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Cleaner form and more informative dish cards
- **Functionality**: Direct app opening improves user workflow
- **Data Quality**: Removed unnecessary URL field, added useful app name data
- **Mobile Experience**: Native app opening provides better user experience

---

### Proposed Implementation
```typescript
// Future server-side implementation
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('dishes')
  .select('*')
  .eq('city', userCity)
  .eq('protein_source', selectedProteinFilter)
  .order('price', { ascending: priceSort === 'low-to-high' })
  .range(0, 19) // Pagination
```

### Impact Assessment
- **Current**: Works fine with small datasets (< 100 dishes)
- **Future**: Will need server-side implementation for scalability
- **Performance**: Client-side sorting is O(n log n) vs database O(n)
- **Network**: Unnecessary data transfer for large datasets
- **Memory**: High browser memory usage with large datasets

### Prevention Measures
- Plan for scalability from the beginning
- Consider performance implications of client-side operations
- Implement server-side sorting for production applications
- Add database indexing for frequently queried columns

### Testing
- [ ] Test current implementation with small dataset (< 50 dishes)
- [ ] Monitor performance with medium dataset (50-200 dishes)
- [ ] Document performance degradation with large datasets
- [ ] Plan server-side implementation for V2

### Notes
- This is a known limitation, not a bug
- Current implementation is acceptable for MVP
- Server-side sorting will be implemented in V2 for performance optimization
- Consider implementing pagination alongside server-side sorting

## [BUG-003] - Homepage Greeting Shows Placeholder Instead of User Name

### Bug Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-003
- **Title**: Homepage Greeting Shows Placeholder Instead of User Name
- **Severity**: Medium (UX)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Date Reported**: 2024-12-19
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

### Description
The homepage greeting displays "Hey User!" instead of the actual user's name, creating a poor user experience where users don't see their personalized greeting.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Observe the greeting message at the top
4. Notice it shows "Hey User!" instead of the actual user's name

### Expected Behavior
- The homepage should display "Hey [Actual User Name]!" using the user's real name from their profile
- The greeting should be personalized and welcoming

### Actual Behavior
- The homepage shows "Hey User!" as a generic placeholder
- No personalization in the greeting message

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems

### Error Details
- **Component**: Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Issue**: Using `user?.user_metadata?.name` which may not contain the user's actual name
- **Root Cause**: Not fetching user name from the secure profile API

### Root Cause
The homepage was using `user?.user_metadata?.name` from the session instead of fetching the user's actual name from the secure `/api/users` endpoint that returns the profile data.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Add userName state** to store the fetched user name:
   ```typescript
   const [userName, setUserName] = useState("User")
   ```

2. **Update profile fetching** to also set the user name:
   ```typescript
   if (response.ok) {
     const data = await response.json()
     setUserCity(data.city || "Mumbai")
     setUserName(data.name || "User")  // ← Added this line
   }
   ```

3. **Remove dependency** on `user?.user_metadata?.name` and use the state variable instead

### Prevention Measures
- Always fetch user profile data from secure API endpoints
- Use consistent state management for user data across components
- Test personalized greetings during development

### Testing
- [x] Verify homepage shows actual user name in greeting
- [x] Test with different user names
- [x] Verify fallback to "User" when name is not available
- [x] Test loading states work correctly

### Notes
- This fix works in conjunction with the security fix for phone number exposure
- The user name is now fetched securely from the profile API
- Maintains consistent user experience across the application

1. Selected delivery app pills were cyan-colored instead of matching the design system
2. Pills were not properly aligned within the dropdown selection frame
3. Vertical padding was uneven (less on top, more on bottom)
4. Pills were not horizontally aligned to the left edge of the dropdown

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Add Dish page
2. Select "Online" as the source type
3. Open the "Delivery Apps" multi-select dropdown
4. Select multiple delivery apps (e.g., "Zomato", "Uber Eats")
5. Observe the styling and alignment of the selected pills

### Expected Behavior
- Selected delivery app pills should match the design system (light gray background, dark text, border)
- Pills should be properly aligned within the dropdown frame
- Vertical alignment should be centered
- Horizontal alignment should be flush to the left edge
- Styling should be consistent with other form elements like "Protein Source" pills

### Actual Behavior
- Selected pills were cyan-colored and didn't match the design system
- Pills were misaligned within the dropdown frame
- Uneven vertical padding (more space below than above)
- Pills were not flush to the left edge of the dropdown
- Inconsistent styling compared to other form elements

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Component**: Add Dish Form (`app/add-dish/page.tsx`)
- **UI Component**: Multi-Select (`components/ui/multi-select.tsx`)

### Error Details
- **Component**: `MultiSelect` component in `components/ui/multi-select.tsx`
- **Issue**: Badge styling and container alignment
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect Badge variant and missing alignment classes

### Root Cause
1. **Badge Styling**: The Badge component was using `variant="outline"` with custom classes that didn't properly override the default styling
2. **Design System Mismatch**: The styling didn't match the Button `outline` variant used elsewhere in the design system

### Resolution Steps
1. **Updated Badge Styling** in `components/ui/multi-select.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   className="mr-1 mb-1 bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80"
   
   // To:
   className="mr-1 mb-1 border border-input bg-background text-foreground hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground"
   ```

2. **Matched Design System**:
   - Used `border border-input bg-background text-foreground` to match Button outline variant
   - Added `hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground` for consistent hover states

### Testing Results
- ✅ Selected delivery app pills now have white background with dark text and border
- ✅ Styling matches the "Protein Source" pills and other form elements
- ✅ Hover states work correctly
- ✅ X icon for removal remains functional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ❌ Alignment issues remain (pills still not properly centered or flush to left edge)

### Prevention Measures
- Always test UI components against the design system
- Use consistent styling patterns across similar components
- Test alignment and spacing in different screen sizes
- Verify hover states and interactive elements work correctly

### Notes
- This fix ensures the multi-select component follows the established design system
- The styling now matches other form elements for consistency
- Alignment issues still need to be addressed in a future update
- The fix maintains all existing functionality while improving visual consistency

## [BUG-006] - Mock Data Removal and Data Quality Issues
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Data Quality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** Development Team

### Description
The application was using mock data as fallbacks in multiple pages, causing inconsistent data display and the "Online" button issue. Mock dishes were appearing instead of real database data, leading to confusion about data sources and validation.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to any page (homepage, my-dishes, my-wishlist)
2. Observe that mock dishes were being displayed
3. Notice the "Online" button appearing for dishes without delivery apps
4. Check that form validation was working but mock data was still showing

### Expected Behavior
- Application should use only database data
- No mock dishes should appear anywhere
- Clear error messages when API calls fail
- Proper empty states when no data is available
- Consistent data source across all pages

### Actual Behavior
- Mock dishes were being displayed as fallbacks
- "Online" button issue was caused by mock data inconsistencies
- Mixed data sources (database + mock data)
- Inconsistent user experience

### Environment

### Root Cause
1. **Mock Data Arrays**: Multiple files contained hardcoded mock dish data
2. **Fallback Logic**: Error handling was falling back to mock data instead of showing proper errors
3. **Data Inconsistency**: Mixed use of database and mock data
4. **Interface Mismatch**: Mock data didn't match current database schema

### Resolution Steps
1. **Removed Mock Data Arrays** from all files:
   - `app/page.tsx`: Removed `mockDishes` array (65+ lines)
   - `app/my-dishes/page.tsx`: Removed `mockDishes` array (65+ lines)
   - `app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`: Removed `mockSavedDishes` array (25+ lines)

2. **Updated Error Handling**:
   - Replaced `setDishes(mockDishes)` with `setDishes([])`
   - Added proper error messages: "Failed to load dishes. Please try again later."
   - Removed fallback to mock data in error scenarios

3. **Fixed Interface Definitions**:
   - Added `delivery_apps?: string[]` to all Dish interfaces
   - Updated prop names from `deliveryAppName` to `deliveryApps`
   - Ensured consistency across all components

4. **Cleaned Up Comments**:
   - Removed "Mock saved dishes data" comment

## [BUG-007] - Wishlist and My Dishes Functionality Not Working
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** Development Team

### Description
The wishlist and My Dishes pages were not functional due to missing API endpoints and incorrect filtering logic. Users could not save dishes to their wishlist, and the My Dishes page was not showing the correct dishes for the current user.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the homepage and click the bookmark icon on any dish
2. Navigate to the My Wishlist page - no dishes appear
3. Navigate to the My Dishes page - incorrect or no dishes appear
4. Refresh the page - bookmark state is lost

### Expected Behavior
- Bookmarking a dish should save it to the user's wishlist in the database
- My Wishlist page should display all saved dishes for the current user
- My Dishes page should display only dishes contributed by the current user
- Bookmark state should persist across page reloads and sessions

### Actual Behavior
- Bookmarking only updated local state, not the database
- My Wishlist page showed empty state with TODO comment
- My Dishes page filtered by user name instead of user ID
- Bookmark state was lost on page refresh

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/api/wishlist/route.ts` (new file)
  - `app/page.tsx`
  - `app/my-dishes/page.tsx`
  - `app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`

### Error Details
- **Root Cause**: Missing wishlist API endpoint and incorrect user filtering logic
- **Impact**: Core functionality broken, poor user experience

### Root Cause
1. **Missing Wishlist API**: No `/api/wishlist` endpoint existed to handle wishlist operations
2. **Local State Only**: Bookmark functionality only updated React state, not database
3. **Incorrect Filtering**: My Dishes page filtered by user name instead of user ID
4. **No Persistence**: Bookmark state was lost on page refresh

### Resolution Steps
1. **Created Wishlist API Endpoint** (`/api/wishlist/route.ts`):
   - **GET**: Fetch user's wishlist with full dish details
   - **POST**: Add dish to wishlist (with duplicate handling)
   - **DELETE**: Remove dish from wishlist
   - Added proper authentication and error handling
   - Used Supabase joins to fetch complete dish information

2. **Updated Homepage Bookmark Functionality** (`app/page.tsx`):
   - Modified `handleBookmarkToggle` to call wishlist API
   - Added `useEffect` to fetch user's wishlist on page load
   - Implemented proper error handling for API calls
   - Fixed TypeScript issues with Set types

3. **Fixed My Dishes Page Filtering** (`app/my-dishes/page.tsx`):
   - Changed filtering from `dish.addedBy === currentUser` to `dish.user_id === currentUserId`
   - Updated Dish interface to include `user_id` field
   - Fixed data transformation to include `user_id` and `delivery_apps`
   - Used `user?.id` instead of `user?.user_metadata?.name`

4. **Updated My Wishlist Page** (`app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`):
   - Replaced TODO with actual wishlist API call
   - Updated `handleBookmarkToggle` to call DELETE API
   - Added proper error handling and loading states
   - Fixed data fetching to use authenticated user

### Testing Results
- ✅ Bookmarking dishes saves to database and persists across page reloads
- ✅ My Wishlist page displays saved dishes correctly
- ✅ My Dishes page shows only current user's contributed dishes
- ✅ Bookmark state persists across browser sessions
- ✅ API endpoints return proper authentication errors for unauthenticated users
- ✅ No linting errors remain
- ✅ All pages load correctly with proper data

### Prevention Measures
- Always implement complete CRUD operations for user data
- Test data persistence across page navigation and browser sessions
- Use user ID for filtering instead of user names
- Implement proper API endpoints before building frontend functionality
- Test authentication and authorization for all API endpoints

### Notes
- This fix restores core functionality for wishlist and user dish management
- The wishlist API follows the same patterns as existing API endpoints
- All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow established patterns
- The application now provides a complete user experience for dish management

## [BUG-008] - Wishlist API Supabase Relationship Error
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** Development Team

### Description
The wishlist API was returning a PGRST201 error due to ambiguous relationship specification in the Supabase query. The error occurred because there are multiple relationships between `dishes` and `users` tables, and Supabase couldn't determine which relationship to use for the join.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the My Wishlist page
2. Observe the error message "Failed to load wishlist. Please try again later."
3. Check browser console for PGRST201 error
4. Try to bookmark a dish from the homepage - it appears to work but doesn't persist

### Expected Behavior
- My Wishlist page should load and display saved dishes
- Bookmarking dishes should persist to the database
- Bookmark state should remain consistent across page navigation

### Actual Behavior
- My Wishlist page shows error message
- Bookmarking appears to work but doesn't persist
- Bookmark state is lost when navigating between pages
- Console shows PGRST201 Supabase relationship error

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Error Code**: PGRST201
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/api/wishlist/route.ts`
  - `app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`

### Error Details
```
Error fetching wishlist: {
  code: 'PGRST201',
  details: [
    {
      cardinality: 'many-to-one',
      embedding: 'dishes with users',
      relationship: 'dishes_user_id_fkey using dishes(user_id) and users(id)'
    },
    {
      cardinality: 'many-to-many',
      embedding: 'dishes with users',
      relationship: 'wishlist_items using wishlist_items_dish_id_fkey(dish_id) and wishlist_items_user_id_fkey(user_id)'
    }
  ],
  hint: "Try changing 'users' to one of the following: 'users!dishes_user_id_fkey', 'users!wishlist_items'. Find the desired relationship in the 'details' key.",
  message: "Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'dishes' and 'users'"
}
```

### Root Cause
The Supabase query in the wishlist API was using an ambiguous relationship specification. When selecting from `wishlist_items` and joining with `dishes`, then trying to embed `users`, Supabase found multiple possible relationships:
1. `dishes_user_id_fkey` - the relationship between dishes and their creators
2. `wishlist_items` - the many-to-many relationship through the junction table

Supabase couldn't determine which relationship to use for the `users` embedding.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Fixed Supabase Query** in `/api/wishlist/route.ts`:
   - Changed `users (name)` to `users!dishes_user_id_fkey (name)`
   - This explicitly specifies which relationship to use for the join
   - Uses the `dishes_user_id_fkey` relationship to get the dish creator's name

2. **Updated Error Message** in `app/my-wishlist/page.tsx`:
   - Removed "Using sample data for now." text
   - Updated to more appropriate error message: "Please check your internet connection or try again later."

### Additional Issue Found
After fixing the PGRST201 error, a new issue was discovered:

**Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Violation:**
```
Error adding to wishlist: {
  code: '42501',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "wishlist_items"'
}
```

**Root Cause:** The `wishlist_items` table has RLS enabled but no policy allowing authenticated users to insert their own wishlist items.

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ GET /api/wishlist works (200 status)
- ❌ POST /api/wishlist fails (500 status) due to RLS policy
- ❌ Bookmarking doesn't persist to database
- ❌ Bookmark state is lost on page refresh

### Testing Results
- ✅ My Wishlist page loads without errors (GET works)
- ❌ Bookmarking dishes fails to persist to database (POST blocked by RLS)
- ❌ Bookmark state is lost on page refresh
- ✅ API returns proper data structure for GET requests
- ✅ No more PGRST201 errors in console
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly

### Prevention Measures
- Always specify explicit relationship names in Supabase queries when multiple relationships exist
- Test API endpoints with actual data to catch relationship ambiguities
- Use Supabase's relationship hints when errors occur
- Verify that joins work correctly with the database schema

### Final Resolution Steps
1. **Created RLS Policies** for `wishlist_items` table:
   ```sql
   -- Enable RLS on wishlist_items table
   ALTER TABLE wishlist_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Policy 1: Allow users to SELECT their own wishlist items
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own wishlist items" ON wishlist_items
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

   -- Policy 2: Allow users to INSERT their own wishlist items
   CREATE POLICY "Users can add to their own wishlist" ON wishlist_items
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

   -- Policy 3: Allow users to DELETE their own wishlist items
   CREATE POLICY "Users can remove from their own wishlist" ON wishlist_items
       FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

2. **Verified Complete Workflow**:
   - ✅ Bookmark dish from homepage works
   - ✅ Dish appears in My Wishlist page
   - ✅ Bookmark state persists across page refreshes
   - ✅ Removing items from wishlist works

### Final Testing Results
- ✅ My Wishlist page loads without errors
- ✅ Bookmarking dishes persists to database
- ✅ Bookmark state remains consistent across page navigation
- ✅ API returns proper data structure for all operations
- ✅ No more PGRST201 errors in console
- ✅ No more RLS policy violation errors
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly
- ✅ Complete wishlist functionality working end-to-end

### Notes
- The PGRST201 relationship error has been fixed
- The explicit relationship specification ensures consistent query behavior
- The error message update improves user experience
- **RLS policies have been created and are working correctly**
- **Bug status is now "Resolved" after user verification confirms complete functionality**

## [BUG-009] - Edit Dish Form Field Order Inconsistency
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** Medium (UX)
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** User

### Description
The edit dish form had a different field order compared to the add dish form, creating inconsistency in the user experience. Users would expect the same field order when editing a dish as when adding a new dish.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Add Dish page
2. Observe the field order: Source Type → Restaurant Name → Dish Name → Protein Source → Photo → Ratings → Comments
3. Navigate to My Dishes page and click Edit on any dish
4. Observe the different field order: Dish Name → Restaurant Name → City → Price → Protein Source → Availability → Delivery Apps → Ratings → Comments

### Expected Behavior
- Edit dish form should have the same field order as the add dish form
- Users should have a consistent experience when adding or editing dishes
- Field order should follow the logical flow: Source Type → Restaurant Name → Dish Name → Protein Source → Ratings → Comments

### Actual Behavior
- Edit dish form had a completely different field order
- Field order was: Dish Name → Restaurant Name → City → Price → Protein Source → Availability → Delivery Apps → Ratings → Comments
- This created confusion and inconsistency in the user experience

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/edit-dish/[id]/page.tsx`

### Error Details
- **Root Cause**: Edit form was implemented with a different field order than the add form
- **Impact**: Inconsistent user experience, confusion when switching between add and edit forms

### Root Cause
The edit dish form was implemented independently from the add dish form, resulting in a different field order. The developer didn't follow the established field order from the add dish form.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Analyzed Add Dish Form Field Order**:
   - Source Type (In-Restaurant/Online)
   - Restaurant Name (conditional on source type)
   - Delivery Apps (Online only)
   - Dish Name
   - Protein Source
   - Photo
   - Taste
   - Protein Content
   - Price
   - Overall Satisfaction
   - Comments

2. **Reordered Edit Dish Form Fields** to match add dish form:
   - Moved Availability (Source Type) to the top
   - Moved Delivery Apps to immediately follow Availability
   - Moved Price into the ratings section
   - Removed City field (hardcoded in add form)
   - Updated form state and validation to remove city references

3. **Updated Form State Management**:
   - Removed `city` state variable and related logic
   - Updated data submission to use original city value
   - Updated validation to remove city requirements

### Testing Results
- ✅ Edit dish form now matches add dish form field order
- ✅ Conditional fields (Delivery Apps) appear in correct position
- ✅ Form validation and submission logic unchanged
- ✅ No linting errors remain
- ✅ User experience is now consistent between add and edit forms

### Prevention Measures
- Always follow established patterns when creating similar forms
- Test form consistency across different user flows
- Use the same field order for related forms to maintain user experience
- Review form layouts for consistency during development

### Notes
- This fix ensures consistent user experience across add and edit forms
- The field order now follows the logical flow established in the add dish form
- All functionality remains intact while improving user experience
- The fix maintains all existing validation and submission logic

## [BUG-010] - Invite Codes Not Displaying on Account Page
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Severity:** High (Core Functionality)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Resolved
**Reporter:** User

### Description
Invite codes were not showing up on the account settings page due to missing RLS policies on the `invite_codes` table. Users could not view their generated invite codes, and the account page showed "No invite codes available" even when codes existed.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Account page
2. Observe that no invite codes are displayed
3. Check browser console for 401 errors
4. Verify that invite codes exist in the database but are not accessible

### Expected Behavior
- Account page should display all user's invite codes (both used and unused)
- Used codes should be visually distinguished from unused codes
- Copy functionality should work for available codes
- Status indicators should clearly show code availability

### Actual Behavior
- Account page showed "No invite codes available"
- API calls to `/api/invite-codes` returned 401 errors
- Users could not view or manage their invite codes
- No visual status indicators for code usage

### Environment
- **Application**: Hypertropher Web App
- **Version**: Development
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Error Code**: 401 (Unauthorized)
- **Files Affected**:

  - `app/account/page.tsx`

### Error Details
```
GET /api/invite-codes 401 in 44ms
{"error":"You are not authorized."}
```

### Root Cause
The `invite_codes` table had RLS enabled but no policies allowing authenticated users to access their own invite codes. This caused all API calls to return 401 errors.

### Resolution Steps
1. **Created RLS Policies** for `invite_codes` table:
   ```sql
   -- Enable RLS on invite_codes table
   ALTER TABLE invite_codes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Policy 1: Allow users to SELECT their own invite codes (both used and unused)
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own invite codes" ON invite_codes
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = generated_by_user_id);

   -- Policy 2: Allow system to INSERT invite codes for users
   CREATE POLICY "System can create invite codes for users" ON invite_codes
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = generated_by_user_id);

   -- Policy 3: Allow system to UPDATE invite codes (mark as used)
   CREATE POLICY "System can update invite codes" ON invite_codes
       FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = generated_by_user_id);
   ```

2. **Updated Invite Codes API** (`/api/invite-codes/route.ts`):
   - Removed `is_used: false` filter to return all codes (used and unused)
   - Updated comment to reflect new behavior
   - Maintained existing functionality for signup flow

3. **Enhanced Account Page UI** (`app/account/page.tsx`):
   - Added visual status indicators for used/unused codes
   - Used codes: grayed out with "Used" label and disabled copy button
   - Unused codes: normal styling with "Available" label and active copy button
   - Removed created date display for cleaner UI
   - Added proper styling with `bg-muted/50 opacity-75` for used codes

### Testing Results
- ✅ Account page displays all invite codes with correct status
- ✅ Used codes are grayed out with "Used" label
- ✅ Unused codes show "Available" label with active copy button
- ✅ Copy functionality works for available codes
- ✅ No 401 errors on invite codes API
- ✅ RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ Signup flow remains unaffected
- ✅ No linting errors remain

### Prevention Measures
- Always implement RLS policies when enabling RLS on tables
- Test API endpoints with actual data to catch access issues
- Verify that joins work correctly with the database schema
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated access scenarios

### Notes
- The RLS policies ensure secure access to invite codes
- The visual status indicators improve user experience
- The API now returns all codes for better account management
- The signup flow remains completely unaffected by these changes
- **Bug status is now "Resolved" after user verification confirms complete functionality**
